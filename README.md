# CHoRUS Bridge2AI Standards Module

## Standards Module Goals
### Progress Tracking
To know how best to support sites, SM needs to understand where sites are in their OMOP transofrmation progress, and where they are meeting friction.

This framework provides an integrated solution for:

- A structured "to-do list" for sites
- A "workspace" for sites to track their own progress, keep notes, and reach out to SM for assistance
- A project management tool for SM to visualize multiple sites' progress and/or friction points

### Discussion/Forums
Along with functionality to support productivity, this framework provides a platform for sharing knowledge between sites and SM. 

Topics can be created for discussion directly in GH Discussions, or via a comment on an individual issue. The linking between issues and forum provides more interconnectedness between forum topics and their sources.
